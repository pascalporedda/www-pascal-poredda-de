title: 'Who do you surround yourself with?'
summary: ''

If you spend your time with lazy, unemployed people, you might not be inspired to work hard 
and actually achieving something in your own life. Fuck those people. If you want to become
something, you probably have to ditch them and find new people.

## Spain is full of unemployed people

## Taking my time off and surrounding myself with lazy fuckers

I have surrounded myself with lazy fuckers for a whole week. It gave me a perspective.
It showed me, why I am, where I am. These people live their lives without any real goal,
except "being happy". Fuck that. If you strive for nothing but simple pleasures, where 
do you go and end up?

It's definitely been an experience, living with 3 unemployed people in the same house for a week.
All they cared about was how to become a better rock climber. Which I can relate and understand.
But I can't on the other hand.

## What's my plan for the next few months and years?

1. I do want to stay here in Spain, that is for sure. 
2. Do I want to be in Germany for the summer? Probably.
3. Do I want to sell the Van? Maybe.
4. Do I want to rent a home in Barcelona or Valencia? Not sure yet.
5. Which business direction do I want to head towards? Building up an service agency is one way
I could sustain an income. I want to work with German clients or other high paying clients
