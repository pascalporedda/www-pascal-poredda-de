## Shipping code to real users

I am an advocate of shipping code fast and see if:

1. The user is actually interested in the feature and uses it
2. And if that, how the user is using the feature and what he would like to see

Too often have I experienced that some smart people come up with brilliant ideas,
of how some potential user might use a feature, just to find out it is the complete opposite.
How many of those cases could have been avoided?
All of them if you ship fast.

## Shipping fast

What do I mean with shipping fast?
Basically, in my opinion, in the first iteration of
a feature you don't care about having code duplications, not perfect UX, not code coverage
and definitely not documentation.
You just want to see if the user is interested in the feature.
So you build the feature, and try to get it to the user as fast as possible.

Does that mean shipping to production?
Not necessarily.
A dedicated environment for testing
that is not your personal computer is enough.

Does that mean that you should not test your code?

No. You should test your code.
