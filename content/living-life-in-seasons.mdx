# Don't give a fu** about getting morning sunlight into your eyes

So I arrived in Spain 4 days ago, and I immediately noticed that their way of living life is different.
Everything happens in a different timeframe. Their dinner is around 10pm, their nightlife starts
the earliest at 1am. People often take a siesta during the day.

And here I am continuing my Germany way of living. Waking up at 6am, getting ready, get sunlight into my eyes,
start work, coffee, more work, workout, more work, dinner at 6pm, get ready for bed at 9pm, sleep at 10pm.
Repeat. If I actually want to enjoy this season of my life, I have to adapt.

## Living life in seasons

Let me tell you a little backstory. I have always been very good at doing things in order, routinely, and to be fair: I love my routines.
They give me a sense of control, a sense of security. Especially since I have been travelling in my van. Without any routines
I just

One of my bad traits is that I try to progress everything at once, I never like to do only one thing.
So, instead of just having climbing as a hobby, I also go dancing, and try to put equal amounts of time
into both hobbies. This has a benefit of not having your identity tied to only one thing, so if one thing
breaks or you cannot do it anymore, you still have other things to fall back on. But it also has a downside.

I lack focus. This is reflecting in my eating habits (I'm constantly snacking), and my phone checking habits (constantly checking for new WhatsApp messages).

Every week each of us has 168 hours to spend. If you sleep 8 hours a day, you have 112 hours left.
You can spend those how you want. I for myself have decided that I'm going to spend my time a little
different this year.

### The summer of my life

I promise myself, that instead of doing anything, of what I have written about in my previous blog posts
[[Building Fastlane Wealth, as a Slowlane success]](/blog/building-fastlane-wealth) I will instead focus on
having the greatest fucking summer of my lifetime.
I will learn Spanish, I will party, I will tan. I will have a great time with people here with the Spaniards.

### What am I even optimizing for?


### I built bad habits, and fear to build even worse

Over the past couple of weeks and months I lost my action taking. Today I listened to Unscripted,
by MJ Demarco. One part about "getting lucky" resonated really deeply with me. It's not that some people
are just lucky. It most of the time simply depends on the actions you take, that shape your chances of 
getting lucky.

I took a lot of actions of getting lucky over the past few years, but have been slacking the past 
few months for sure. For what I have done the past few months, I definitely got way more out of what I've put into.
And I am thankful for this, but in the meantime I lost a lot of my dedication, my good habits, and self respect.

Let's put this into examples. 

1. I used to do intermittent fasting everyday, 16-18 hours. Now I eat regularly breakfast, snack a lot inbetween 
meals and have late dinners. I remember how it made me feel most of the time: Pretty fucking great. It was super
easy getting into a flow state for coding, with some black coffee and sparkling water on the side. Now I 
start my day with a banana, an apple and some dark chocolate followed by either eggs or porrdige. 

2. I was training with more dedication, grit and higher pain tolerance. 

3. I didn't check my phone whilst I was working. I notice this especially currently, as I am freshly dating
this American girl. I'm checking my phone for notifications way more often, seeing if she texted me or not.
Back then I simply put it on flight mode, and didn't touch it for many hours. 

4. Not thinking about the consequences things might have. Since I met this girl we had sex a couple of times,
and I barely know her. It's been only about 2 weeks soon. And we even had unprotected sex. And I don't want
children right now. I simply don't want them now. This would have a big impact on my life, that I don't want
right now. Later, for sure. Right now, no. This is probably one of the really big things I have to look out for.
Taking actions that have long term consequences, without thinking logically about them.

5. Lacking communication. I'm unsure if I can measure this correctly, but I think I was certainly better
at this many years ago.

## Stop optimizing, stop caring, stop being so hard on yourself

Doing 6 months of focused work periods, followed by 6 months of exploration, fun and relaxation, 
followed by 6 more months of work might be a better approach. 

Doing 2 years of building something great, followed by a longer period of relaxation and fun, might also work.

But accepting that during those focused periods things like weight gain might go up, the gym might not be the top
priority, or that you might not attend too many parties is necessary.

Always feeling like you're missing out on something is going to hold you back. 
Accepting that you can't do everything at once is the way to go.


## A season of fun

- smoked my first joint last Friday
  had amazing sex whilst being high
  had a good time with friends and spent some time building relationships with other people
  had my first all nighter in a long long time 
- I enjoyed most of it, but the aftermath of the day after is definitely not my thing. Not being able to get work done, 
  or grind towards something else is not something I like. I want to progress, and I'm not good at balancing
- Can I do both? Progress in life and have fun? When I have fun I do build routines and habits that are not good for 
the long term, like staying up late, not having a good circadian rhytm 
- Can one build a successful business and good habits, whilst still having a fun life?
- Doing great work does require commitment. Am I willing to commit and have a miserable life whilst going there?
