# WhatsApp Voice: A Chrome extension for transcribing voice messages

I have built my first Chrome extension that integrates with WhatsApp Web. This idea
stems from the frustration of having to listen to a 5-minute-long voice note a friend sent me
that could have been summarized in 10 seconds.

I _hate_ listening to voice messages. I prefer reading. Voice is one of the slowest ways to communicate,
and I prefer to optimize things.
So I decided to have a small fun project, a little Chrome extension that helps me to transcribe voice notes,
and summarize them.

## Why a Chrome extension?

I do use WhatsApp a lot for communicating with friends and business partners, but I prefer to use it on my desktop.
I do not like typing on my phone since I am way faster on my Moonlander keyboard.
I personally do not have the WhatsApp Web Desktop app installed.
Instead, I always use the web version inside my Arc browser because it is easier to have that open in the background without it occupying a spot in my ALT-Tab list.

Choosing to build a Chrome extension comes with the drawback that not too many people use the browser version anymore,
most people rely on the desktop app or the mobile app.
Integrating yourself into those apps is not really possible without writing your very own WA client, which is also possible,
but way more effort.

I have stumbled over a GitHub project called [WhatsApp WebJS](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js),
which is a library that allows you to interact with the WhatsApp Web interface.
It is not an official library from WhatsApp, sadly such does not exist,
This library works using a headless browser to interact with the WhatsApp Web interface,
which you then can script.
With such you could build your own WhatsApp bot or a fully custom WhatsApp client.

In my case I could not use this library directly, but it surely helped me to understand how the WhatsApp Web interface works.

## "Reverse engineering" WhatsApp Web

The problem I faced was quite clear.
I had a voice message that I wanted the user to be able to transcribe.
My extension should integrate seamlessly into the UI, with a very lightweight UX.

There should be a simple button, and within the click of a button the message should be transcribed, and the transcription should be displayed
as if it was part of the normal WhatsApp UI.

I had to figure out how to interact with the voice message, how to extract the audio data, and how to send it to a transcription service.
Since Whisper by OpenAI is so good, I knew that the "hard part" of transcribing was already done, I just had to figure out how to get the audio data.

I started by inspecting the Network traffic that was happening when I started to play an audio message in WhatsApp Web.
I noticed that the audio data was being streamed from a URL,
but the URL was not directly accessible, since it was a blob URL.

<Image src="/images/chrome-extension/network-tab-inspecting-whatsapp-web.png" alt={'Me inspecting the network tab, when I clicked on the play button of a voice note.'} width={900} height={300} />

My initial thought was I could simply build a network interceptor that could duplex the audio data.
Sadly, it is not possible to intercept such blob URLs with a Chrome extension; therefore, I needed an alternative way.
So I started to look into the mentioned library WhatsApp WebJS,
and found that they have a way to download and send media data, so it must be possible to extract the audio data from the voice message.

WhatsApp Web does store everything inside an IndexedDB, which is a browser-based database.
Inside there reside all the messages, contacts, and so forth.

Every message has a unique ID, which WhatsApp uses to identify the message. And luckily, they write these IDs into the DOM,
so I could easily extract them.
With this ID I could then query the IndexedDB for the message.
With this message I could then extract the audio data and send it to my server.

## Getting the audio data from a voice message

The first step was to get all voice messages that are visible in the current chat. This was fairly straight forward.
As already mentioned, they write every single MessageID into the DOM, so I could simply query for all elements that have a `data-id` attribute.

```typescript
  const elements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-id]');
  const nodes: HTMLCanvasElement[] = [];
  if (elements.length) {
    elements.forEach(element => {
      const id = element.getAttribute('data-id');

      // false indicates that this message is from someone else, and not from ME
      if (!id || !id.startsWith('false_')) return;

      const waveformElement = element.querySelector('canvas');

      if (id && waveformElement && !waveformElement.getAttribute('msg-id')) {
        waveformElement.setAttribute('msg-id', id);
        waveformElement.style.position = 'relative';
      }

      if (waveformElement) {
        nodes.push(waveformElement);
      }
    });
  }
```
I appended a simple button with an absolute positioning to each of the waveform elements, so the user
could simply click on it and have the message transcribed.

So now I had to figure out how to get the audio data from the clicked message.
Luckily,
the library WhatsApp WebJS does provide some utility functions that it uses internally to interact with the WhatsApp API:

- https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/blob/066d8fa75ebc13b9cc74cfcd18ffd847b79be998/src/util/Injected/Store.js
- https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js/blob/066d8fa75ebc13b9cc74cfcd18ffd847b79be998/src/util/Injected/Utils.js

These two little scripts do a lot of the heavy lifting
and expose the internal WhatsApp API to the browser window object.
Inside these scripts reside the important helper methods I needed in order for my extension to work.

All I had to do was pass the message ID to the `window.Store.Msg.get` method,
which would then return the message object if it existed.
I then could check if this message was actually a voice message, and if it is, download its blob data.
Then I could simply send that data to my server.
The snippet for this:

```typescript
  const storeMsg = window.Store.Msg.get(messageId);

  const contactId = storeMsg.from?._serialized;

  let username = 'User';
  if (contactId) {
    const contact = window.Store.Contact.get(contactId);

    if (contact) {
      username = contact.name.split(' ')[0] || contact.pushname || username;
    }
  }

  // @ts-expect-error - accessing window object
  const msg = window.WWebJS.getMessageModel(storeMsg);
  // @ts-expect-error - accessing window object
  const dlFn = window.Store.DownloadManager.downloadAndDecrypt || window.Store.DownloadManager.downloadAndMaybeDecrypt;

  if (msg && isAudio(msg)) {
    dlFn({
      directPath: msg.directPath,
      encFilehash: msg.encFilehash,
      filehash: msg.filehash,
      mediaKey: msg.mediaKey,
      mediaKeyTimestamp: msg.mediaKeyTimestamp,
      type: msg.type,
      signal: new AbortController().signal,
    }).then((blobData: ArrayBuffer) => {
      const blob = new Blob([blobData], { type: 'application/octet-stream' });
      const reader = new FileReader();

      reader.onload = function () {
        if (!reader.result || typeof reader.result !== 'string') return;

        // data is base64 encoded
        const voiceMessageData = reader.result.split(',')[1];

        const data = {
          data: voiceMessageData,
          mimetype: msg.mimetype,
          fileSize: msg.size,
          duration: Number(msg.mediaObject?.contentInfo?.duration ?? msg.duration ?? 0),
          id: msg.id._serialized,
          username,
        };

        // send this data to the server...
      };

      reader.readAsDataURL(blob);
    });
  }
```

Something to mention here is that WA does base64 encode the audio data, so I had to decode it on my server.
I also wanted to figure out the contact name that the user was interacting with.
I then could pass this to my server as well, simply because I wanted ChatGPT later to be able to summarize the message in a more personal way.

Sending the data to my server was fairly simple.
I simply relied on the fetch API to send the data to my server. If it was successful, I would store the message in a Chrome storage, so I could access it later,
even if the browser session ended.
If an error occurred, I wanted to be notified, so I integrated Sentry alongside.

```typescript
const { id: messageId, ...data } = event.data;

fetch(API_URL, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => {
    return messagesStore.upsertMessage(messageId, {
      id: messageId,
      formattedText: response.formattedText,
      summary: response.summary,
      transcribedText: response.transcription,
    });
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error transcribing audio message', error);

    sentryClient.captureException(error, {
      data,
    });

    return messagesStore.updateMessageError(messageId, {
      message: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
    });
  });
```

## The easy bit: Transcribing & Summarizing the audio data on my server

The easy part was to stitch together a basic Node.js server that would accept the data sent by the Chrome extension.
I used Express for this and the Whisper API to transcribe the audio data, and ChatGPT to summarize the transcription.

It is a basic server that does not do much, but it does the job. Does this scale? Not really. Is it secure? Not really.
Could it be exploited?
Yes, for sure.
But for now, just to get the job done, it is good enough.

The route looks like this:

```javascript
app.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { data, mimetype, fileSize, duration, id, username } = req.body;

    // Convert base64 to a Buffer
    const audioBuffer = Buffer.from(data, 'base64');
    const fileName = `${uuid.v4()}.mp3`;
    const filePath = path.join(__dirname, fileName);

    // Save the buffer to a file
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, audioBuffer);

    // Create form data
    const form = new FormData();
    form.append('model', 'whisper-1');
    form.append('file', fs.createReadStream(filePath));

    // Call OpenAI Whisper API
    const transcriptionResponse = await axios.post('https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions', form, {
      headers: {
        ...form.getHeaders(),
        Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
      },
    });

    // Clean up
    fs.unlinkSync(filePath);

    const transcription = transcriptionResponse.data.text;

    if (!transcription) {
      return res;
    }

    const summaryResponse = await axios.post(
      'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
      {
        model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
        messages: buildMessagesBody(username, transcription),
      },
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        },
      },
    );

    const responseText = summaryResponse.data.choices[0].message.content;

    const [formattedText, summary] = responseText.split('---!###!---');

    res.json({
      id,
      transcription,
      formattedText: formattedText.trim(),
      summary: summary.trim(),
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error processing request:', error.response ? error.response.data : error.message);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});
```

There are tons of options to improve upon, but for now, it does the job.

## Building a Content UI for the Chrome extension

One part was to neatly display all the content UI somehow inside the WhatsApp web interface.
Chrome extensions do provide a way to inject your own content scripts into the page, that can be CSS and JavaScript.

I opted into [using a boilerplate that I found on GitHub](https://github.com/Jonghakseo/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react-vite), which had everything configured already,
so all I had to do was build the UI with the stuff I already knew.

All I had to do was figure out how to append my buttons to the waveform elements,
and the message transcription below the voice message.
I used React portals to keep the UI state still inside React but render it outside the React tree.
On top, I already figured out where the waveform elements where in the DOM,
so I could traverse around that element and append my custom elements that way.

## Event dispatching for communication

One of the issues I faced was the problem of communicating between the content script and the background script.
Because of Chrome restrictions, I could not simply do the fetch request from within the content script,
instead I had to rely on dispatching events. The content script would dispatch an event, and the background script would listen for that event and then do the fetch request.

Once the fetch request was done, the background script would dispatch another event, which the content script would listen for.
Doing it that way seemed a bit overkill, but since Chromes Manifest V3 this is the way to go.

```typescript

## What have I learned?

The whole process of building this Chrome extension was a great learning experience for me.
It took me, in total, maybe 10 hours to build. I had to figure out how Chrome extensions work, how to interact with the WhatsApp Web interface, and how to reverse engineer code that isn't mine.
I learned how simple it is to integrate Whisper by OpenAI into your application and how good Whisper is.

Things I am concerned about and would improve upon:

1. If WhatsApp changes its codebase or API, my extension possibly could break overnight. Sadly they don't have an official API, so I had to rely on what was there.
2. Data privacy concerns. I am sending all the audio data to my server, where I am storing them temporarily to be able to send the data to Whisper. Especially in countries like Germany,
    this could be a big concern.
I would have to figure out a way to make this more secure,
and maybe even not store the data at all, and at best make sure it doesn't even leave the user's computer at all.
3. Whisper is expensive. Transcribing a few longer voice notes does cost a few cents. If you scale this up, this could add up quickly

Overall, I am happy with the result, and I am using it daily. It saves me a lot of time, and I can now read voice messages in seconds instead of minutes.
I am thinking about open-sourcing this project, but I am not sure if I want to maintain it.

I really enjoy building small projects like this, and I am looking forward to building more Chrome extensions in the future.
I will soon release this app to the public on the Chrome store so stay tuned!
