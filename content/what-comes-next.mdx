title: 'What comes next?'
summary: 'Why do you never want to work again? Why achieve financial independence?'
---

Playing 6 hours of video games, sleeping in for 10 hours, eating out everyday,
now having to deal with assholes? But what comes next? What is the f** point of
financial independence?

## What is my freedom number?

If I reach 1.500 Euros a month, that would allow me to cover my basic lifestyle,
without saving too much money, or doing crazy expensive trips, but definitely 
something that is achieveable.

## What do I want to get out of this?

Let's say this in bulletpoints:

1. I want to build a lifestyle where I don't have to worry if on someday, I only
work 4 hours a day. Or on another day work 8. I want the flexibility, without being 
tied to a single client.

2. I want to have the possiblity to focus on multiple things in my life and become
exceptional at climbing and dancing.

3. I want to help other people by either teaching them things I'm already good at,
or provide them value by giving them my time for free.

4. I want to be able to not worry about how much money I'm spending on food and travel

5. I want to be comfortable with myself. And proud of what I have done.

6. I don't want to have to trade my time for money.

7. Building wealth comes either down to having a lot of properties or just building a cash flow
business. You need to provide value.

**I do not want to live a live of what if's.**

## What experiences do I want to have in my life?

I personally don't get too much value out of travelling too much, I'm grateful 
for the possiblities that I currently have, but it is definitely not a necessity 
for me. 

## Is it really about not working anymore?

I truly believe that I cannot not work. I need to get my personal worth from something, right?
People that don't contribute to something do get depressed, fairly often. 
But the work does not need to be about the money, sometimes. If you enjoy your work,
because maybe you are organizing trips with people and do fun stuff, it might be ok
to have a little less pay, but get the value out of something else.

## Business, Freelance, Working, Travelling

I figured out that I'm not really into travelling all too much. I enjoy staying at one place
for a longer time, and then maybe travel a bit around the area. But I don't need to be on the 
road all the time. If you're constantly going on the road, you are wasting a lot of time on driving
and getting somewhere, but everytime is the same.

It's nice in the moment, but get's bland after a while. Having a Van is a thing some people would 
dream about, and it's nice to do it like once for a while, but having a homebase is just my thing.

The only option I currently have bene thinking about that seems to be viable is to build out my Freelance
career, help other startups or work for a big company like Vercel. I do have a ideas in my head that I
could start building software wise, but you never know until you sold it once.

First sell, than build.

Selling the Van would give me a lot of leeweigh for at least a year where I could afford a decent apparment
and an office somewhere that has enough AC going so I could stay cool in the hot summer.

I will continue my journey until my contract runs out the way it is now. I will enjoy it. I will start
building other things on the side, to get some traction of building.

I cannot spend too much time with wasteful people like Leon. I love him, and for climbing he is great, but for anything else
it's a bit
