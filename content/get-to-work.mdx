## What I haven't done

Two days ago I started my documenting my fastlane journey on this blog 
(https://pascal-poredda.de/blog/get-to-work-1)[Building fastlane wealth, as a slowlane success].
To be fair, not too much work happened since then. I'm still doing the freelance project, 
that I spent most of my days time on, besides I worked on learning more Spanish and went
outside climbing. In a private reflection I wrote yesterday that this kind of lifestyle that 
I'm currently living isn't really productive if you wanna do actual great work. Maybe it's just me
or my personality, but I feel like I need to be in a certain environment to be able to do great work.

So I haven't gotten to work.

## What I have done

I was always having this voice and attention in my background, trying to find and grasp problems
that are worth pursuing. I think I found a few. I'm not sure if they are worth pursuing, but they
sound great to me. Just to list a few:

1. Problem: Finding problems and things to solve
Possible solution: A website that gives you ideas scraped from websites like Quora, TFF 
and other websites. 

2. Problem: Having a great idea, but no clue how to get to action, and actually knowing it's a great
fastlane business idea.
Possible solution: myidea2action.com use GPT with custom prompting to turn your idea into an action
plan, validating it against the CENTS framework.

3. Problem: Having ChatGPT stop or not completely give you the full implementation of a method
Possible solution: Someone should build a chrome extension that parses the output and if it did 
not complete the whole method, request it automatically from GPT.

Are any of these viable? I don't know. Would I have fun working on them? Definitely, but that's not a 
warrant for success. 

I want to build stuff on the internet. I want to have a name for building cool and fun stuff on X.com,
and become a successful. When I write this down I notice that I'm violating another rule. 

Fuck this ego thing.
How can I serve other people?
