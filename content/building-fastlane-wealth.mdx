This blog post is part of documenting my business (success) journey. 
The last few years I was a wantrepreneur. Always listening
and consuming business content, business books, Hormozi videos,. It felt so good,
listening to all of this. But I never took any action!
I was stuck in my own rat race. I was probably a slowlane success.
25 years old, no debt, net worth of more than 150k and making 10-15k a month as a 
freelancer. I know how to live cheap, know how to be a minimalist and know what I value
and what I don't. [Life should be good](https://pascal-poredda.de/blog/i-already-achieved-it),
but it wasn't. 

Last I took the decision change my life 2024, and got to work.
The goal: Get out of the miserable headspace I'm in. Move away from Germany, to a different country
where the weather is better, and the culture is different. Follow the advices you have listened
to so many times already, don't trade your time for money. Start building a wealth vehicle that
has unlimited leverage you can control.

I'm on the road down south to Spain in my RV. I have no clear plan on where I end, but I 
have my laptop, Starlink, savings the need to live a different life. Leaving my known
surroundings helps me see my own life from another perspective. I have no material baggage,
I sold all of my stuff back home, waived goodbye and went on the road. 
Right now I'm writing this from somewhere near Fontainebleau in France. I'm currently
staying nearby a horse stable, with a friend from the UK and in our freetime we 
go bouldering in the forest. 

## I want to feel the consequences. Good or bad.

I have been working as a Freelancer starting 2023 in June. I make great
money doing so, the job is not too stressful and I have a decent amount of freedom,
but I don't on the other hand. Having to do pointless meetings. Having to plan and decide
with over people over the products features and architecture. Not getting any punishment out
over a products failure. And not getting any reward out of a products success. It just 
meaningless.


With freelance projects you can earn good money. I make between 10-15k net a month, without working myself to the grave. I always put
a big chunk of that money into savings, and since I'm living a slowlane lifestyle: 
Saving money on $6 starbucks lattes. I was able to save a good amount, that helps me
stay relaxed with starting my own business. 

The contract with the client was a longterm contract running one year. So it will close 
in a few months. I have decided to not renew the contract with the client, and embark on a new
journey. 

## Where to go from here?

I will start a real business. Not a freelancer, one person show business.
Recently a guy I have been following for many years on X.com posted a job offering.
He is looking for a contractor that can help him with his two startups. He has been
decently succesful, and I want to learn how he did it. The deal is to work 4 days for
him and his products, on the other days I will spend the major chunk of the day working
on my own product. His compensation offer is not as high as my current freelance gig,
but I'm willing to take the risk and the pay cut. I want to learn from him, and I want
to be able to work on my own product. 

Everyday I will now take a good chunk of the day to figure the what and how out. I will
listen closely and observe of what people are complaing about, and what could be solved 
by a software piece. Something I can build.

I will keep you updated on my journey.
