## Is yak shaving always a bad thing?
“Yak shaving” gets tossed around as a pejorative in meetings to imply inefficiency or wasteful work: “This is a bad idea because it’s going to introduce a shitload of yak shaving we don’t have time for.”

But sometimes we describe “any work that I don’t personally find enjoyable” as yak shaving — things like planning and measurement, for example. This decreases the perceived value of really important work, and sometimes leads to skipping it altogether.

Not all meaningful work is fun. Not all boring work is meaningless. This is a lesson that’s dangerously easy to forget, because the modern attitude toward work makes it extremely easy to confuse “motion” with “progress”, and “busy” with “productive”.

> Yak shaving is an unfortunate side-effect of having survived to adulthood.

To put that another way, nothing is ever all fun, all the time. We have to pay bills, run errands, clean up after ourselves, and dozens of other mundane tasks that are just part of being a grown-up.

By devaluing important-but-not-fun tasks as useless yak shaving and skipping them, we might create the illusion of progress — but we also might miss the dirt floors, potentially burning countless hours on meaningless-but-fun Real Work™.

## There’s more than one way to shave a yak.

Some chores are just that: chores. We have to do the dishes sometimes; bills need to be paid if we want the lights to stay on; we probably ought to shower every once in a while.

But other chores fall into a different category, which I like to call “meta-work”.

Meta-work is the work we do before the Real Work™ to make it more efficient and productive.

This is something like installing a dishwasher or putting the bills on auto-pay.

On the surface, “set up auto-pay” seems like just another chore on a list of yak-shavey bullshit work, but there’s a key difference: when executed well, meta-work requires an up-front investment, then little (or no) additional effort afterward.

Paying bills isn’t hard, but it takes time an attention every month. By contrast, setting up auto-pay takes a bit more work to set up, but afterward requires zero additional work to ensure bills get paid on time.

Put another way, putting in the meta-work means the yak stays shaved.
